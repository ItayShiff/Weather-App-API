# Weather-App-API
An application that provides current weather about any city in the world.
Made with interaction with couple APIs such as:
* JavaScript Geolocation (To get user's location).
* Google Custom Search (To generate a picture in the background and make spelling corrections).
* Pexels (Fallback in case Google API doesn't work, so generating a picture from Pexels).
* OpenWeatherMap (To get the weather information).
